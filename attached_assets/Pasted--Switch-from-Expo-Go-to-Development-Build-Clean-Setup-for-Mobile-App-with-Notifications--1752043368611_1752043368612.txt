# 📱 Switch from Expo Go to Development Build (Clean Setup) for Mobile App with Notifications

## 🎯 Goal:
I want to use Development Build instead of Expo Go so I can enable features like **push notifications** and other native capabilities. I’ve imported my existing Expo project into Replit. Please clean up the code and set everything up correctly for a **Production-Ready Dev Build**.

## ✅ Tasks for Replit AI

1. **Clean Up Boilerplate**
   - Remove unused files, comments, and default code.
   - Structure the code into `components`, `screens`, `services`, etc.
   - Ensure code is readable and consistent (e.g., formatting, naming).

2. **Install and Configure Expo Dev Build**
   - Install the latest `eas-cli`
   - Initialize with `eas init`
   - Setup `eas.json` with development profile:
     ```json
     {
       "build": {
         "development": {
           "developmentClient": true,
           "distribution": "internal"
         },
         "preview": {},
         "production": {}
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Update `app.json` or `app.config.js`**
   - Add or verify:
     ```json
     {
       "expo": {
         "scheme": "myapp",
         "plugins": ["expo-notifications"],
         "android": {
           "package": "com.myapp.mobile",
           "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
         },
         "ios": {
           "bundleIdentifier": "com.myapp.mobile",
           "googleServicesFile": "./GoogleService-Info.plist"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Configure Notifications**
   - Install: `expo install expo-notifications`
   - Setup notification permissions and listeners in code
   - Include sample push test code for both Android and iOS

5. **Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
   - Guide me to generate FCM keys and add:
     - `google-services.json` (Android)
     - `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
   - Enable push notifications via FCM in the app

6. **Run Dev Build**
   - Build dev client: `eas build --platform android --profile development`
   - Download and install APK for testing
   - Verify push notifications are working

7. **Guide to Future Development**
   - How to push updates using EAS Update
   - How to test push notifications
   - How to prepare for production build

## 💡 Note
I am using **Replit** so make sure all commands work in this environment or guide me step-by-step if something must be done on a local machine.

## 🧼 Final Goal
A clean, working mobile app using Expo’s Development Build with notification support, ready for further native features.
